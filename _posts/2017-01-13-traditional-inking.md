For this week's update I decided to experiment and try inking it with real ink. I usually work 100% digitally, but ever since my obsession with Sean Murphy a few weeks back, I've been more and more tempted to try traditional media, for a few reasons.

1) Originals- It's nice to have a physical copy of the page instead of a file on my computer. Originals can be sold for way more than prints, and I like the idea of having a file somewhere full of fully inked pages of BHSB

2) Traditional Inking <i>usually</i> gives me better line quality.  I've noticed that when I ink in manga studio the ends of lines and corners come out a little to pointy.

3) No more zooming in and out. Technically I ink "zoomed in" because the page is a lot bigger than what you'd see in print or online, but I don't have to worry about zooming in to make sure I know what's actually happening with the pixels, or zoom out to see how the marks I just made relate to the area around them.

Overall, I wasn't very happy with how these pages turned out. I've been messing around with ink in my sketchbook for the last few weeks, and they usually turn out something like this

or this.

But when I try to ink a comic page, which people will actually see, I get this.

As soon as I printed out my digital pencils I was committed to them, which wasn't exactly a good thing. while I'm inking I tend to find issues that need to be redrawn, so I go back and forth between pencils and inks while I'm "inking." For this page I ran into some parts that I wanted to redraw but couldn't, so I tried to figure it out on the fly, and the final product suffered for it.

I did like the process of working with a brush and a bottle of ink. I don't have a dedicated work space, so I ended up inking in bed which was kind of nice. It was also good to be away from the computer, because it helped me focus on the task at hand, instead of switching between YouTube videos and getting distracted by my twitter feed.

I do want to try this again, since my sketchbook has solid evidence that traditional inking can look reeeeally good, but I'll be a lot more caution next time. I'd like to start penciling with an actual pencil too, but baby steps.  This was a good learning experience, but I think I'm going to go back and redo this page.
